This is a project to simulate the growth of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the past five years between 2013-2017. This project takes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and analyzes the CPI of each year, placing it into separate Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). The overall CPI of each year is extracted from each RDD, and then stored into a DataFrame. The average, minimum, and maximum CPI of each year is then determined, before combining the average CPI of each year into another DataFrame. The PySpark dataframes are converted to Pandas dataframes for plotting the CPI of each year to determine whether the economy has been in inflation, deflation, or stable over the past five years. I do not own any data. All data belongs to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data can be downloaded from https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-files/home.htm.
